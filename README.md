"What I learnt building for Windows 8" - DDD Sydney 2012
=========

## What this contains

The demo app I built to show off various things I demonstrated at DDD Sydney:

 - testing your UI at design time using VS/Blend
 - testing your UI using the simulator
 - testing your app using touch and mouse (even without hardware)
 - customising app icons and how that flow
 - tile and toast notifications inside your app
 - integrating search into your app
 - testing your app for marketplace

Things I didn't get around to covering:

 - background workers (pending favour of demo gods)
 - testing
 - MVVM
 - styling your app components
